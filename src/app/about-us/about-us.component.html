            One million species are at risk of extinction and people all over the world are already feeling the effects of climate crisis.
            Scientists say we have a little over 10 years left to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
            Protecting and restoring forests is one of the best defences we have against climate breakdown.
            Yet some of the biggest brands in the world are still profiting from forest destruction.
            10 years ago, hundreds of the worldâ€™s biggest companies made a promise to end forest destruction by 2020.
            With only a few months left, they are nowhere near this goal.
